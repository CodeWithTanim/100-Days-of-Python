# Python Programming - Day 2: Our First Program

Welcome to **Day 2** of your Python programming journey! 🚀 Today, we're going to write our **first-ever Python program**. It's going to be simple, yet essential for your learning. Let's get started! 🎉

---

## 📝 Objective

In this lesson, you'll:

- Learn how to use the `print()` function in Python.
- Write your very first program to display a message on the console.
- Complete a mini-quiz to practice by printing a poem of your choice.

## 💻 Our First Python Program

The `print()` function in Python is used to display information to the console. This is how we communicate with the user and the outside world through a Python program.

### Example: 

Here’s the first program you'll write:

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```
Running this program will display Hello, World! on your screen. While this may seem basic, it's the foundation of many more advanced Python programs!

## 🏆 Your Challenge:
Write a Python program to print your favorite poem. Pick any poem you like, and use the print() function to display each line.

### Example:
```python
print("The Road Not Taken by Robert Frost")
print("Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,")
print("And sorry I could not travel both")
print("And be one traveler, long I stood...")
```
Once you're done, commnet the code you have wirte in this video.🌟

### ✅ Things to Remember
- Don’t skip any tasks, even if they seem easy. Every step is important in building a solid foundation in Python.
- This is the start of your Python journey, so keep practicing and experimenting with what you learn!
Consistency is key! Try to code a little bit each day.

### 🔜 What’s Next?

Now that you've completed Day 2, you're well on your way to becoming proficient in Python. Keep up the momentum, because Day 3 will introduce you to variables and data types—exciting stuff!



### Happy coding! 💻✨
